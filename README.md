#Data:
***
  
The data is a public domain dataset gathered by Amazon Mechanical Turk using Biometric data collected from the Fitbit devices of 30 willing users.  The Fitbit devices were connected to a 3rd party online software  system, Fitabase, which allowed access of 1 month retrospective and prospective data from the date of consent.  The data was collected over the time period of March 12th, 2016, to May 12th, 2016.
  
I will use the ROCCC framework in order to assess the integrity and credibility of this dataset.

Reliability: The data was collected from monetarily incentivized participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk rather than a randomly selected sample of individuals.  Although, studies have shown that Mturkers are more demographically diverse than standard convenience samples and may be generalizable to the greater population the study lists limitations contradicting this.

Originality: The data was collected by a third-party organization.

Comprehensive: The original goal of the study this data was collected for was to test the feasibility of extracting personal Fitbit data from remote survey respondents and link biometric data to questionnaire health data. 
 This dataset currently does not provide any of the questionnaire data that was originally linked to biometric data and the original intent was not determine trends among a sample representative of a population.

Current: The data was collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12th, 2016, and May 12th, 2016, therefore data may not accurately reflect current trends.

Cited: The data was collected from a panel Mturkers, a workforce of individuals willing to participate in online research studies in exchange for monetary incentive.  The data is cited, and limitations as well as the goal of the study described in a separate document.  Furberg, R., Brinton, J., Keating, M., & Ortiz, A. (2016). Crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.53894

The data is incomprehensive and is not up-to-current, therefore my analysis will provide hints into possible trends and marketing strategy recommendations.  Subsequent analysis with a more comprehensive and current dataset is required to verify these findings.
